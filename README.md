# Pacman

This project is one of those that I'm proud of a lot because it is something that works visually.  It primarily is based on Swing 
GUI and relies heavily on Java classes. It works in the following way, the PacManGame class calls the MazeFrame to initialize the frame which in turn calls the MazePanel class.
